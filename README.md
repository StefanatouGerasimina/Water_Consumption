# Water_Consumption_timeseries_forecasting


## Introduction

The scope of this project is the analysis of the time series for hourly 
water consumption data and the creation of a model to predict the daily water consumption for the next year.

The given dataset, provides hourly data on water consumption for the years 2002 to 2016 and consists of two columns:

- Datetime: This column records the date and time of the observation. The format used is 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SSâ€™.
- Consumption: This column shows the water consumption, presumably measured in a specific unit during each  datetime.

An example of the hourly, daily and weekly water consumption timeseries is shown bellow:

## Basic Statistics

- As we take a first look at the dataset's summary, we notice that there are no missing values.
- The average hourly water consumption goes up to 32187 units.
- Standard deviation of 6489.8 units.
- Minimum hourly water consumption of 14544.0 units.
- Maximum hourly water consumption of 62009.0 units.

### Timeseries Distribution

- The distribution appears to be roughly bell-shaped, indicating a normal distribution. This suggests that most measurements fall near the mean, and the frequency decreases as you move away from the center in either direction.
- The spread or dispersion seems quite large, with significant frequencies ranging from about 10k to over 50k. This indicates a wide range of water consumption values among the measured subjects or entities.
- The distribution appears to be slightly skewed to the right, suggesting that there are more high consumption values than low consumption outliers. This is indicated by the long tail on the right side of the distribution. This refers to the positive skewness.

Positive skewness also can be shown from the wiskers diagram:
